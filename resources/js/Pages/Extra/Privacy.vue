                        <h4 class="text-2xl font-bold">Your Access to and Control Over Information</h4>
                        <p> You may opt out of any future contacts from us at any time. You can do the following at any
                            time by contacting us via the email address or phone number given on our website: </p>

                        <h4 class="text-2xl font-bold">Security</h4>
                        <p> We take precautions to protect your information. When you submit sensitive information via
                            the website, your information is protected both online and offline. </p>
                        <p> Wherever we collect sensitive information (such as credit card data), that information is
                            encrypted and transmitted to us in a secure way. You can verify this by looking for a closed
                            lock icon at the bottom of your web browser, or looking for "https" at the beginning of the
                            address of the web page. </p>
                        <p> While we use encryption to protect sensitive information transmitted online, we also protect
                            your information offline. Only employees who need the information to perform a specific job
                            (for example, billing or customer service) are granted access to personally identifiable
                            information. The computers/servers in which we store personally identifiable information are
                            kept in a secure environment. </p>
